Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions. This is more prevalent at Google than at other places I've been, because we're surrounded by counting problems, probability problems, and other Discrete Math 101 situations


============= Google ==============
Hey,

It was a pleasure speaking with you today and congratulations on moving to the technical interview stage!

In the next couple of days, you'll receive an email from a colleague of mine with exact details regarding the technical interview time, date and shared document for digital white-boarding.

In the mean-time, here is a [technical interview prep video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWbUtlUhwa8) as well as a more formal prep document (attached).  Secondly, I've had a lot of current Google engineers tell me this blog by [Steve Yegge](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html) helped them in preparing for their interviews, so thought I'd pass it along as well. Lastly, here is a [Power Poses Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc) that someone sent me before my Google interview and I love to share with potential future Googlers like yourself! 

Also, there seems to be a strong correlation between success in the interviews and candidates who 1. Prepare 2. Practice - so if you have someone like Bryce to help with practice, it will definitely help.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Things to keep in mind when you interview with Google: 

1) Interview Questions
Interview topics may cover anything on your CV, whiteboard coding questions, building and developing complex algorithms and analyzing their performance characteristics, logic problems, systems design and core computer science principles - hash tables, stacks, arrays, etc. Computer Science fundamentals are prerequisite for all engineering roles at Google, regardless of seniority, due to the complexities and global scale of the projects you would end up participating in.

2) How to succeed: Always let your interviewer know what you are thinking as he/she is as interested in your thought process and how you approach the problem as the solution itself. Also, if you're stuck, they may provide hints if they know what you're doing.
If there is anything you don’t understand - it is okay to ask your interviewer for help or clarification.
When asked to provide a solution, first define and frame the problem as you see it.
If you need to assume something - verbally check that it is a correct assumption!
Describe how you want to tackle solving each part of the question.

3) What is Google looking for?
Think about ways to improve the solution you'll present. As you begin to think about the problem, the first answer that springs to mind may need some refining. It is worthwhile to talk about your initial thoughts to a question. Ask clarifying questions if you do not understand the problem or need more information. Many of the questions asked in Google interviews are deliberately underspecified because our engineers are looking to see how you engage the problem. In particular, they are looking to see which areas leap to your mind as the most important piece of the technological puzzle you've been presented.

4) Technical Preparation Tips
The main topics that front end software engineers should prepare for include coding, algorithm design/analysis, system design (such as, feature sets, interfaces, class hierarchies), and some open-ended discussion (biggest challenges faced, best/worst designs seen, performance analysis and optimization).

Algorithms and Data Structures:
Be sure to review algorithms and data structures (in particular hashtables, heaps, and binary search trees). You likely will be asked to design an algorithm and write code.
Be comfortable with Big-O analysis of running-time complexity.  Be prepared to explain the running-time complexity of algorithms you know and are asked to devise.
Don’t be afraid to iterate through the problems presented to you - your interviewer is interested in knowing if you understand the problem and can answer it. Remember to leave time to focus on utilizing better data structures and algorithms.
Sorting: Know the details of at least one n*log(n) sorting algorithm, preferably two (say, quicksort and mergesort) - mergesort can be highly useful in situations where quicksort is impractical, so take a look at it.
Know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem, and be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks you them in disguise. Find out what NP-complete means. 
Trees: Familiarize yourself with binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees. Be familiar with at least one type of balanced binary tree, whether it's a red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree, and know how it's implemented. 
Coding:
We do not expect you to memorize every API in the standard library. It's fine if you forget a method name. However, we do expect you to use proper syntax and to use relevant data structures & language features appropriately.
Make sure your code is clean, bug-free and properly handles edge cases. Avoid writing pseudo-code unless directed to do so.
You don’t need to reinvent the wheel. For example, if your particular language supports a sort function, you do not need to write your own sort routine unless the interviewer specifically requests otherwise.

============= AirBnB ==============
Hi,

It was great chatting with you just now. Please see below some recommendations and more information about Airbnb front-end. Once you take a look, could you please send me some interview dates? We interview M-F, except Wednesdays, 9am-5pm. 

A few blogs below:

------------------------------------------------

PREP for Phone Interview:

For the phone interview, you’ll need to have a computer with internet access for the coding portion of the interview. You will need to complete them without any aids engineers typically have access to, e.g. IDE, online docs and you will be under the time gun.

We don't have sample questions, but our phone interviews for frontend engineers tend to be more practical than algorithmic. The questions vary, but in general they are focused on your knowledge areas of javascript-html-css. 

This is a good site to brush up on Javascript: http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/ and to get brushed up on the basics, try this site as well: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide
The interview will last 45 minutes
Your interview will be conducted in either Coderpad (http://coderpad.io) or Codepen (http://codepen.io). Your interviewer will email you the link during your interview.
Feel free to use any of the preprocessors, libraries, and frameworks that Codepen supports during your interview unless told otherwise by your interviewer. Codepen supports: 
JavaScript Preprocessors: CoffeeScript, LiveScript, TypeScript, Babel, 
JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks: jQuery, Ember, Angular, React, Backbone, Lodash, Underscore, Handlebars, Polymer
CSS Preprocessors: LESS, Sass, SCSS, PostCSS
You can debug in Codepen via the Chrome/Firefox/Safari developer console. All stack traces related to your code will come from `solution.js`. 
Tip: You will be assessed on both speed as well as quality of the solution. So, don’t take too much time to think through the problem, but take enough time so you can provide a clean and elegant solution. For some questions, the expectation is that someone should be able to work through the problem in X minutes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREP for Onsite (sending this now so you can practice if you'd like!)

The qualities we care about in coding interviews are the same across the board but at the onsite stage there is one general coding interview where the problem will focus on CS fundamentals.  

This step we will prep you thoroughly for but it is made up of an 2 frontend coding interviews, a general coding interview (CS fundamentals), Experience interview (where you talk about a project that showcases your skills) and a few non-technical interviews.


What we look for and CS fundamental prep

Video: [Hangout on Air: Google Candidate Coaching Session: Tech Interviewing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWbUtlUhwa8&feature=youtu.be) directly from Google interviewers. Please feel free to bypass the first 5 minutes of this video and please don’t mind that this is a Google video…it is great content!

1) Plan ahead
The Airbnb engineers who will be interviewing you have only limited time set aside from their projects, so please reserve time in your schedule, too! This also helps you relax and perform better at the interview.

2) Interview Questions
Interview topics may cover any of the following: anything mentioned on your CV, whiteboard coding questions, building / developing complex algorithms and analyzing their performance characteristics, logic problems, systems design / core computer science principles (hash tables, stacks, arrays, etc). Computer Science fundamentals are prerequisite for all engineering roles at Airbnb, regardless of seniority, due to the complexities and scale of the projects you would end up participating in.

3) How to prepare (depending on how much time you have)
Work with a buddy. It’s a good idea to have someone you can discuss problems with (and you can mock interview each other).
Take up a programming project at work - It will give you some more coding practice.
Make a list of all the mistakes you make while writing code (for/while boundary conditions, bottomless recursion or recursion that returns nothing, syntax or API usage errors, etc). Read that list often and avoid making that mistake. Every time you avoid such a mistake — pat yourself on the back!

4) How to succeed
At Airbnb, we believe in collaboration and sharing ideas. Most importantly, you'll need more information from the interviewer to analyze & answer the question to its full extent.
1) When they ask you about the projects you’ve worked on, make sure that you show them a good understanding of why you chose the implementations that you did, and you weren’t just following what someone asked you to do. It’s important to go into depth about the projects you’ve worked on to show what you passionate about.

2) It is OK to question your interviewer.

3) When asked to provide a solution, first define and frame the problem as you see it.

4) If you don't understand - ask for help or clarification.

5) If you need to assume something - verbally check that it is a correct assumption!

6) Describe how you want to tackle solving each part of the question.

7) Always talk through the problem! Always let your interviewer know what you are thinking as he/she will be as interested in your process of thought as your solution. Also, if you're stuck, they may provide hints if they know what you're doing. Please keep in mind that they’ll be looking to get through a couple different problems, so avoid spending the entire time on solving just one.

8) Find and fix your bugs using pointers, edge cases, abstraction, unit test or others.


5) What is Airbnb looking for?
Think about ways to improve the solution you'll present. In many cases, the first answer that springs to mind may need some refining. It is worthwhile to talk about your initial thoughts to a question. A brute force explanation will be received less positively than taking time to compose a more efficient solution. Ask clarifying questions if you do not understand the problem or need more information. Many of the questions asked in Airbnb interviews are deliberately underspecified because our engineers are looking to see how you engage the problem. In particular, they are looking to see which areas leap to your mind as the most important piece of the technological puzzle you've been presented.

6) Ask more questions!
Make sure you have a decent understanding of Airbnb as a business. At the end of the interview, most interviewers will ask you if you have any questions about the company, work environment, their experience, etc. It is clever to have some prepared for each interview, but don't worry too much if your mind goes blank. If you have questions about the interview process, remuneration or your performance, please direct these to your recruiter.

Algorithms:
It’s fairly critical that you understand big-O complexity analysis. Again, run some practice problems to get this down in application.
Be sure to review algorithms and data structures (in particular hashtables, heaps, and binary search trees). You likely will be asked to design an algorithm and write code. Please make sure your code is clean, bug-free, and avoid writing pseudo-code unless directed to do so.
Don’t be afraid of iterating through the problems presented to you - your interviewer is interested in knowing if you understand the problem and can answer it. Remember to leave time to focus on utilizing better data structures and algorithms.
Sorting: Know the details of at least one n*log(n) sorting algorithm, preferably two (say, quicksort and mergesort) - mergesort can be highly useful in situations where quicksort is impractical, so take a look at it.
Hashtables: Arguably the single most important data structure known to mankind. You absolutely should know how they work. Be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language, in about the space of one interview.
Trees: Know about trees; basic tree construction, traversal and manipulation algorithms. Familiarize yourself with binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees. Be familiar with at least one type of balanced binary tree, whether it's a red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree, and know how it's implemented. Understand tree traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder.
Know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem, and be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks you them in disguise. Find out what NP-complete means.
Coding:
We are not looking for memorization of all APIs. It’s fine if you forget a method or class name. However, we do expect utilization of proper syntax, variable declaration/initialization, error checking, and effective use of appropriate data structures.
Be comfortable with Big-O and analysis of running-time complexity. Be prepared to explain the running-time complexity of algorithms you know and are asked to devise.
Graphs:
There are 3 basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list); familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: breadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code.
System Design:
Be sure to review design patterns, class structures, caching and scalability.
User Interfaces and Layout:
Brush up here.
Mathematics:
Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions. This is more prevalent at Airbnb than at other companies because we are surrounded by counting problems, probability problems, and other Discrete Math 101 situations. Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of combinatorics and probability. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk -- the more the better.
Understand how different primitive types (such as integers) are represented, and what boolean/binary mathematics can be applied. Study power of tens table.
Operating Systems:
Know about processes, threads and concurrency issues. Know about locks, mutexes, semaphores and monitors - and how they work. Know about deadlock / livelock and how to avoid them.
Know what resources a process needs, a thread needs, and how context switching works (know how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware). Know a little about scheduling. The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, so know the fundamentals of "modern" concurrency constructs.
7) Focus Areas
To practice for your interview you may want to visit [Top Coder](https://www.topcoder.com/) (If you launch the "Arena" widget, you can enter the practice rooms where you can play with the problems in the first/second division as a warm up)

[Coding](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxTvoZCNzGBoRGIyUU5jSDY4RzA/view) – What to expect 
– 45 minute interview with 1-2 coding questions on a whiteboard (if on site) or laptop (if remote).
 – You will be tested on your problem solving and core CS fundamental skills (theory, algorithms, data structures, design patterns, recursions, binary tree questions, etc.)
 – You will need to think of an efficient, optimized and bug-free solution to code up quickly and concisely in whatever language you code best in.
 – Try to have 1-2 questions prepared for the end for your interviewer.
 
Helpful coding tips and practice
 – Most people study and practice on a whiteboard or coding competition websites beforehand.
 – Discuss initial ideas and solutions with your interviewer, which will help clarify any ambiguity.
 – Take hints from your interviewer to showcase your thought process & problem-solving ability. 
 – Generally avoid solutions with lots of edge cases or huge if/else if/else blocks. Deciding between iteration and recursion is always an important step.
 – Think about different algorithms and algorithmic techniques (sorting, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming/memorization, recursion).
 – Think about data structures, particularly the ones used most often (Array, Stack/Queue, Hashset/Hashmap/Hashtable/Dictionary, Tree/Binary Tree, Heap, Graph, Bloom Filter, etc.)
 – Don’t worry about rote memorization such as runtimes or API/native calls. It's good to know how to figure out approximate runtimes on the fly but the code you write is more important. 
 – You will be asked about o Memory constraints on the complexity of the algorithm you are writing (and its running time - O(N^2) to O(N) etc.
 
I know this is a lot of information but please let me know if you have any questions! 
 
Regards!

=========== AMAZON ===============

The coding test itself is 90 minutes, with 15 minutes for a multiple choice question and a brief survey afterward. You cannot stop a section once you’ve begun, so I encourage you to be in a quiet spot ahead of time where you can focus without distraction. The link is valid for 7 days.

 
A few things to note:

- You can use any of the following languages you’re comfortable with: C#, C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, or JavaScript.

- We are interested in your demonstration of problem solving, writing correct code, applying patterns/data structures, and optimizing for algorithmic performance on the tests. It’s best to mentally prepare for this.

 
To best prepare for the online coding challenge, here are some resources:

•            Fundamentals: Go back and re-educate yourself on all data structures and data structure algorithms. They come up all the time. Understand all time and space complexity. Make sure you even get into more exotic things like hashmaps, b+trees (and variants), caches (and associated algorithms). You may want to visit www.codechef.com

•            Project Euler - http://projecteuler.net/. If you’ve been out of practice, do up to problem 60 or so. You should be forced to build useful libraries, which will help give practical experience for interview like problems. Don’t cheat or take shortcuts.

•            Google Coding Contest has additional practice questions: http://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html

•            Understand high scale architecture. Go look at how other big sites are structured:
http://highscalability.com/blog/category/example

•            Try out this demo version of the assessment. This is an online practice version of the user interface and functionality: https://www.myamcat.com/amazon-lateral-demo
