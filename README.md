# Codelab

This is a collection of algorithmic solutions written in ES2016.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. It is not assumed you would need to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) on your local machine to run the tests in this repo.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

First you will need to clone [the repo](https://github.com/MrSnickers/Codelab) here to your local computer.
```
git clone https://github.com/MrSnickers/Codelab.git
```

navigate into the repo and install node and yarn, if they are not installed globally.  Then install the dependencies for the app with:
```
yarn install
```

## Running the tests

Running the tests is the only thing this repo can do.  That is done with the command
```
yarn test
```
the tests also include a linting step with the AirBnB style guide.

## Built With

* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) - The testing framework used
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - Dependency Management
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - I wouldn't know what to do without it
